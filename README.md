# Laptop

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Requirements

We support:

* [OS X Mavericks (10.9)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567)
* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

## Install

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/headwayio/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

## Debugging

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/headwayio/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

## What it sets up

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby libraries
* [Exuberant Ctags] for indexing files for vim tab completion
* [Foreman] for managing web processes
* [hub] for interacting with the GitHub API

* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries
* [ImageMagick] for cropping and resizing images
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [Postgres] for storing relational data
* [Qt] for headless JavaScript testing via Capybara Webkit
* [Redis] for storing key-value data
* [Ruby] stable for writing general-purpose code
* [Tmux] for saving project state and switching between projects

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

## Customize in `~/.laptop.local`

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew_tap 'caskroom/cask'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'brew-cask'

brew cask install dropbox
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install rdio

gem_install_or_update 'parity'

brew_install_or_upgrade 'tree'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'watch'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`brew_install_or_upgrade`, and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.
